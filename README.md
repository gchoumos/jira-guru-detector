# Jira - Guru Detector

This repository is the implementation of a tool that will be able to recommend a "Guru" for anything that a person inside a company might need help with.

In order to achieve this, the company's Jira platform will be used as it holds precious data that can aid towards this goal.

This is the very early stage of the project. For the moment I want to create a "data_downloader" script that will be able to query the jira platform using REST api and gather the data into csv files that will be later processed in order to make it easy to extract features from them.

Prerequisites:

* ? 
* ?

To-Do:

- Maybe add the requirements to a requirements.txt file and then add the instruction to use `pip install -r requirements.txt`
